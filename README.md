- Users are able to search the car registration number or student name to find the associated child, and associated student name and brief inforamtion will show in the related class box.

- Users can also click the car registration number on the left and student name on the right to find the desired student.

- Once the name is shown the user should be able to mark that student has left the class.

- After pressing Leave Button, a proper message will be shown to indicate that the child has already left.

- User can also press 'Still here' Button to cancel Leave status if some issues happen and student comes back.

- For each class, a counter should be shown how many students have left and how many are left in the class.

- A student can be associated with multiple vehicles.

It is a full-stack web project that uses axios HTTP requests.
